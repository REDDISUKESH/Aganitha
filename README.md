## Description
#### " This project is a simple blog application built using React.js and Material-UI. It allows users to view a list of blog posts, search for posts by title or content, view individual post details, and navigate between different pages such as Home, About, and Contact. The application fetches data from a public API (JSONPlaceholder) to populate the blog posts. It also includes features like pagination, responsive design for different screen sizes, and highlighting search results in post titles and content. Additionally, the application includes a dark mode toggle and a responsive navbar with a drawer for mobile devices. Overall, the project demonstrates the use of React.js, Material-UI, routing, state management, API fetching, and responsive design techniques in a blog application context."
